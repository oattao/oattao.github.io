Today I start learning a new programing language: Javascript. So much difficulties. But I have to try because the [TensorflowJs] applications runing on browser look so cool. Anyway, I don't need to be hurry. Slow down and enjoy the progress. Check out my first javascript app: [Faceplace] - play with your face.
