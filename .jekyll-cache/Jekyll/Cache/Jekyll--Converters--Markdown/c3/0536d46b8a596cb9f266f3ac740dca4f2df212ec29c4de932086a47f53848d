I"õ<p>Today I start learning a new programing language: Javascript. So much difficulties. But I have to try because the <a href="https://blog.tensorflow.org/2020/03/face-and-hand-tracking-in-browser-with-mediapipe-and-tensorflowjs.html">TensorflowJs</a> applications runing on browser look so cool. Anyway, I donâ€™t need to be hurry. Slow down and enjoy the progress. Check out my first javascript app: <a href="http://localhost:4000/apps/faceplace/index.html">Faceplace</a> - play with your face.</p>
