I"÷<p>This is the first time I make a website. I donâ€™t know why I want to do this. Maybe because I am going to graduate next semester and and start my developer career. And maybe building a website is a good begining. With this website, I am going to share things that I think they helpfull or funny for orther people. Again, welcome!. Connect me on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/duytang.hoang">Facebook</a> and take a look on <a href="https://www.github.com/oattao">my github repositories</a>.</p>
