I"p<p>Today I start learning a new programing language: Javascript. So much difficult. But I have to try because the <a href="https://blog.tensorflow.org/2020/03/face-and-hand-tracking-in-browser-with-mediapipe-and-tensorflowjs.html">TensorflowJs</a> applications runing on Browser look so cool. Anyway, I donâ€™t need to be hurry. Slow down and enjoy the progress.</p>
